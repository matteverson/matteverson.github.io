Consumer PCs have bloatware like dogs have ticks. It’s their natural state, the
contrary is only maintained with attention and effort. The unforgivable sin is
to install poorly designed bloatware. Apple can afford an indulgence, so iTunes
exits purgatory and spreads like kudzu. Lenovo’s Panopticon receives no such
grace. They get a [class action lawsuit][lawsuit] and widespread opprobium.

Much of it is deserved. If a bakery [used grain contaminated with fungicidal
mercury for bread][mercury], the bakery wouldn’t plead that some of their bread
was unaffected, and they weren’t making any more bread with that grain, and
anyway the danger was theoretical because nobody had lost a limb that they knew
of. The tone-deaf response would prove they had insufficient expertise to make
claims about the subject.

Manufacturers are the new kids on the block when it comes to information
security. Lenovo is a technology company but policing a supply chain of any
kind is difficult. If we judge by their uninformed response they probably lack
the resources to verify the suppliers claims or vet their security
independently. They are in the Trust Zone, where you’ve lost control but kept
responsibility.

Security is an unsolved scalability problem. Small businesses aren’t able to
replicate the security posture of enterprises. The costs of security tools like
firewalls, log monitoring solutions, and vulnerability scanners scale faster
than threats coverage. The average home network places their faith in a $40
router they may not even have rights to configure. This is all before we talk
about behavioral analytics, real time response, and threat analysis.

The lawsuit and furor are the working out of new cultural expectations for
manufacturers. It isn’t technically possible to secure all the things today.
But it should be possible to vet non-critical inputs that are added to goose
profitability, and it is essential to respond to issues with a plan that
includes expert assistance.
